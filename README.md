he user visits the site and sees a page with a brief description of the service. He also notices the “Login using Facebook” button, clicking on which the FB offers him to allow access to his basic information from the FB.

He permits access, after which a page opens in the header of which he sees his name (from FB), and in the center of the page is the inscription “You have no memories”.

Somewhere nearby is also the “Add Memories” button. He clicks on it and sees a form with the ability to indicate a place on the map, as well as a field for entering a name and a field for entering a comment about this place.

Next, the user clicks the “Save” button, after which he again gets to the home page, where he sees a list of one element - the newly added memory-place.

Subsequently, he adds other places that are also displayed in the list on the home page.

After the user has added all his recently visited places, he clicks on the “Exit” button, after which he returns to the welcome page of the service and can no longer see the previously entered places.

After a while, he returns to the service, logs in again through FB and sees a list of previously saved months
